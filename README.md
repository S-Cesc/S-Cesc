- 👋 Hi, I’m @S-Cesc, and I have been working in software architecture for over thirty years.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming languages, data structures, databases and, touching the AI world, knowledge representation,
as well as computer science teaching and learning.

- I'm pending to publish some content.
  - I have some content in [mòduls cicles FP](https://www.fpcesc.epizy.com/?i=1) 
  - I also work on my freetimes in [cescacs](https://cescacs.orgfree.com/)
  - [***cescacs*** is also in github](https://github.com/cescacs)
