- 👋 Hi, I’m @S-Cesc, and I have been working in software architecture since I began to program my Commodore-64 computer using hexadecimal binary programming, in 1982, as I was a child and I haven't got an assembler, and I needed to use BASIC poke instructions to load the program into memory. My first important program was Conway's Game of Life, which I knew from Martin Gardner; On my version two players were introducing in turns their own bacteria. Next, in the 1994 1st course of FIB computer science, I wrote a BASIC interpreter for PDP-11, maybe to contradict my programming teacher, who said it was too complicated for a first-year student..
- I’m interested in programming languages, data structures, databases, numerical analysis, and, touching the AI world, knowledge representation and common sense (I'm a big fan of Marvin Minsky, who visited FIB in 1992), as well as computer science teaching and learning.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, and my interest focus on WebAssembly.
- 📫 How to reach me:
  - I spend some of my free time working on [cescacs](https://cescacs.orgfree.com/) project.
  - [***cescacs*** is also in github](https://github.com/cescacs)
